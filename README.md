# Algolia Index Management

This repository contains two scripts, `import.js` and `export.js`, which allow you to manage Algolia indices. These scripts help you export index configurations and import them into other indices. Below, I'll explain how to use each script.

## Prerequisites

Before using the scripts, make sure you have the following:

1. Algolia Application ID
2. Algolia Write API Key

## export.js

The `export.js` script exports all the indices from your Algolia app into a JSON file. Here's how to use it:

1. Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual Algolia Application ID and API Key.
2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   node export.js <app_id> <api_key>
   ```

3. The script will create a `export.json` file containing the index configurations (settings, synonyms, etc.).

## import.js

The `import.js` script imports index configurations from a JSON file back into Algolia. Follow these steps:

1. Replace the placeholders in the script with your Algolia Application ID and API Key.
2. Ensure you have the export.json file (generated by export.js) in the same directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
node import.js <app_id> <api_key>
```

4. The script will apply the settings and other configurations from the `export.json` file to the corresponding indices.
